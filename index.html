      <h2>Apache IoTDB (incubating) (Database for Internet of Things)</h2>
      <p>
        Apache IoTDB (incubating) (Database for Internet of Things) is an integrated data management engine designed for
        timeseries data. It provides users with services for data collection, storage and analysis. Due to its
        light-weight architecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with Apache
        Hadoop and Spark, Apache IoTDB (incubating) can meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data
        ingestion and complex data analysis in the IoT industrial fields.

        Disclaimer: Apache IoTDB (incubating) (Database for Internet of Things) is an effort undergoing incubation at
        The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly
        accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
        process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
        not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has
        yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
