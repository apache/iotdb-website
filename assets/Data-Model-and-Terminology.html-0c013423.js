The hierarchical from top to bottom is: power group layer - power plant layer - entity layer - measurement layer. ROOT is the root node, and each node of measurement layer is a leaf node. In the process of using IoTDB, the attributes on the path from ROOT node is directly connected to each leaf node with &quot;.&quot;, thus forming the name of a timeseries in IoTDB. For example, The left-most path in Figure 2.1 can generate a timeseries named <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>.</p><center><img style="width:100%;max-width:800px;max-height:600px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/github/122668849-b1c69280-d1ec-11eb-83cb-3b73c40bdf72.png"></center><p>Here are the basic concepts of the model involved in IoTDB.</p><h2 id="measurement-entity-database-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-entity-database-path" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Measurement, Entity, Database, Path</h2><h3 id="measurement-also-called-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#measurement-also-called-field" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Measurement (Also called field)</h3><p>It is information measured by detection equipment in an actual scene and can transform the sensed information into an electrical signal or other desired form of information output and send it to IoTDB. In IoTDB, all data and paths stored are organized in units of measurements.</p><h3 id="entity-also-called-device" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#entity-also-called-device" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Entity (Also called device)</h3><p><strong>An entity</strong> is an equipped with measurements in real scenarios. In IoTDB, all measurements should have their corresponding entities.</p><h3 id="database" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Database</h3><p><strong>A group of entities.</strong> Users can create any prefix path as a database. Provided that there are four timeseries <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>, <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature</code>, <code>root.ln.wf02.wt02.hardware</code>, <code>root.ln.wf02.wt02.status</code>, two devices <code>wt01</code>, <code>wt02</code> under the path <code>root.ln</code> may belong to the same owner or the same manufacturer, so d1 and d2 are closely related. At this point, the prefix path root.vehicle can be designated as a database, which will enable IoTDB to store all devices under it in the same folder. Newly added devices under <code>root.ln</code> will also belong to this database.</p><blockquote><p>Note1: A full path (<code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code> as in the above example) is not allowed to be set as a database.</p><p>Note2: The prefix of a timeseries must belong to a database. Before creating a timeseries, users must set which database the series belongs to. Only timeseries whose database is set can be persisted to disk.</p><p>Note3: The number of character in the path as database, including <code>root.</code>, shall not exceed 64.</p></blockquote><p>Once a prefix path is set as a database, the database settings cannot be changed.</p><p>After a database is set, the ancestral layers, children and descendant layers of the corresponding prefix path are not allowed to be set up again (for example, after <code>root.ln</code> is set as the database, the root layer and <code>root.ln.wf01</code> are not allowed to be created as database).</p><p>The Layer Name of database can only consist of characters, numbers, and underscores, like <code>root.storagegroup_1</code>.</p><h3 id="path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#path" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Path</h3><p>A <code>path</code> is an expression that conforms to the following constraints:</p><div class="language-sql line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sql"><pre class="language-sql"><code>path

For example, <code>root.vehicle.*.sensor1</code> represents a 4-node path which is prefixed with <code>root.vehicle</code> and suffixed with <code>sensor1</code>.</p><p><code>**</code> represents (<code>*</code>)+, which is one or more nodes of <code>*</code>. For example, <code>root.vehicle.device1.**</code> represents all paths prefixed by <code>root.vehicle.device1</code> with nodes num greater than or equal to 4, like <code>root.vehicle.device1.*</code>, <code>root.vehicle.device1.*.*</code>, <code>root.vehicle.device1.*.*.*</code>, etc; <code>root.vehicle.**.sensor1</code> represents a path which is prefixed with <code>root.vehicle</code> and suffixed with <code>sensor1</code> and has at least 4 nodes.</p><blockquote><p>Note1: Wildcard <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> cannot be placed at the beginning of the path.</p></blockquote><h2 id="timeseries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#timeseries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Timeseries</h2><h3 id="timestamp" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#timestamp" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Timestamp</h3>',7),b=t('<h3 id="data-point" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-point" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Data point</h3><p><strong>A &quot;time-value&quot; pair</strong>.</p><h3 id="timeseries-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#timeseries-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Timeseries</h3><p><strong>The record of a measurement of an entity on the time axis.</strong> Timeseries is a series of data points.</p><p>A measurement of an entity corresponds to a timeseries.</p><p>Also called meter, timeline, and tag, parameter in real time database.</p><p>For example, if entity wt01 in power plant wf01 of power group ln has a measurement named status, its timeseries can be expressed as: <code>root.ln.wf01.wt01.status</code>.</p><h3 id="aligned-timeseries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aligned-timeseries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aligned timeseries</h3><p>There is a situation that multiple measurements of an entity are sampled simultaneously in practical applications, forming multiple timeseries with the same time column.
