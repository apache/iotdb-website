We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any the community notices and corrects any inadvertent mistakes people answering the query may make.</li><li>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to result in a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.</li><li>Be collaborative. Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.</li><li>Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to the appropriate forum. Those who receive a question should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Apache project code.</li><li>Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</li></ol><ul><li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li><li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li><li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li><li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people&#39;s personally identifying information (&quot;doxing&quot;).</li><li>Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or from unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.</li><li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li><li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li><li>Excessive or unnecessary profanity.</li><li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li><li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li></ul><ol start="6"><li>Be concise. Keep in mind that, over time, hundreds or thousands of people will read what you write. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary at the top of the message.<br> Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each email adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.<br> Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long.</li><li>Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project&#39;s goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual&#39;s choice to leave the project.</li></ol><h3 id="_5-release-creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-release-creation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.Release Creation</h3><h4 id="_5-1-the-release-manager" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-1-the-release-manager" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.1 The release manager</h4><p>Our project designates a committer to be the release manager who takes responsibility for the mechanics of a release.

After receiving an email, if developers have any suggestions or doubts ,then reply to the email.<br> Step 3: RM releases a Release Candidate. After the opinions from community developers are fully considered, RM (Release Manager) releases a Release Candidate via email for the developers to test and vote.<br> Step 4: Community developers vote. Community developers receive the Release Candidate and test it. Then, vote by email.<br> Step 5: After the Release Candidate is voted through, RM releases an official version and makes an announcement. When the voting results meet the prescribed situation, RM releases an official version and announces the news by email. (If the Release Candidate fails, RM announces the failure of the new release by email. The process can be restarted after modification. ）</p><h4 id="_5-3-how-to-test-the-release-candidate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-3-how-to-test-the-release-candidate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.3 How to Test the Release Candidate</h4>',14),A={href:"https://iotdb.apache.org/Development/VoteRelease.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=i('<h4 id="_5-4-vote-template" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-4-vote-template" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.4 Vote Template</h4><p>The notation used in voting is:</p><ul><li>+1 Yes, I agree</li><li>0 I have no strong opinion</li><li>-1 I object on the following grounds<br> If you object you must support your objection and provide an alternative course of action that you are willing and able to implement (where appropriate).</li></ul><h4 id="_5-5-decision-making" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-decision-making" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5.5 Decision Making</h4><p>According to the instructions given by Apache Software Foundation, we will keep the voting window for at least 72h.
