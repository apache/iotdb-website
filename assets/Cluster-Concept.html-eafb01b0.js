Over half of the ConfigNodes is Running could the cluster work.</p><p>DataNode stores the data and schema of the cluster, which manages multiple data regions and schema regions. Data is a time-value pair, and schema is the path and data type of each time series.</p><p>Client could only connect to the DataNode for operation.</p><h3 id="concepts" tabindex="-1"><a

aria-hidden="true">#</a> Characteristics of Cluster</h2><ul><li>Native Cluster Architecture <ul><li>All modules are designed for cluster.</li><li>Standalone is a special form of Cluster.</li></ul></li><li>High Scalability <ul><li>Support adding nodes in a few seconds without data migration.</li></ul></li><li>Massive Parallel Processing Architecture <ul><li>Adopt the MPP architecture and volcano module for data processing, which have high extensibility.</li></ul></li><li>Configurable Consensus Protocol <ul><li>We could adopt different consensus protocol for data replicas and schema replicas.</li></ul></li><li>Extensible Partition Strategy <ul><li>The cluster adopts the lookup table for data and schema partitions, which is flexible to extend.</li></ul></li><li>Built-in Metric Framework <ul><li>Monitor the status of each node in cluster.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="partitioning-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#partitioning-strategy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Partitioning Strategy</h2><p>The partitioning strategy partitions data and schema into different Regions, and allocates Regions to different DataNodes.</p><p>It is recommended to set 1 database, and the cluster will dynamically allocate resources according to the number of nodes and cores.</p><p>The database contains multiple SchemaRegions and DataRegions, which are managed by DataNodes.</p><ul><li>Schema partition strategy <ul><li>For a time series schema, the ConfigNode maps the device ID (full path from root to the penultimate tier node) into a SeriesSlot and allocate this SeriesSlot to a SchemaRegionGroup.</li></ul></li><li>Data partition strategy <ul><li>For a time series data point, the ConfigNode will map to a SeriesSlot according to the DeviceId, and then map it to a SeriesTimeSlot according to the timestamp, and allocate this SeriesTimeSlot to a DataRegionGroup.</li></ul></li></ul><p>IoTDB uses a slot-based partitioning strategy, so the size of the partition information is controllable and does not grow infinitely with the number of time series or devices.</p><p>Regions will be allocated to different DataNodes to avoid single point of failure, and the load balance of different DataNodes will be ensured when Regions are allocated.</p><h2 id="replication-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#replication-strategy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Replication Strategy</h2><p>The replication strategy replicates data in multiple replicas, which are copies of each other. Multiple copies can provide high-availability services together and tolerate the failure of some copies.</p><p>A region is the basic unit of replication. Multiple replicas of a region construct a high-availability RegionGroup.</p><ul><li>Replication and consensus <ul><li>ConfigNode Group: Consisting of all ConfigNodes.</li><li>SchemaRegionGroup: The cluster has multiple SchemaRegionGroups, and each SchemaRegionGroup has multiple SchemaRegions with the same id.</li><li>DataRegionGroup: The cluster has multiple DataRegionGroups, and each DataRegionGroup has multiple DataRegions with the same id.</li></ul></li></ul><p>An illustration of the partition allocation in cluster:</p><img style="width:100%;max-width:500px;max-height:500px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" src="https://alioss.timecho.com/docs/img/UserGuide/Cluster/Data-Partition.png?raw=true"><p>The figure contains 1 SchemaRegionGroup, and the schema_replication_factor is 3, so the 3 white SchemaRegion-0s form a replication group.</p><p>The figure contains 3 DataRegionGroups, and the data_replication_factor is 3, so there are 9 DataRegions in total.</p><h2 id="consensus-protocol-consistency-protocol" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#consensus-protocol-consistency-protocol" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Consensus Protocol (Consistency Protocol)</h2><p>Among multiple Regions of each RegionGroup, consistency is guaranteed through a consensus protocol, which routes read and write requests to multiple replicas.</p><ul><li>Current supported consensus protocol <ul><li>SimpleConsensus：Provide strong consistency, could only be used when replica is 1, which is the empty implementation of the consensus protocol.</li><li>IoTConsensus：Provide eventual consistency, could be used in any number of replicas, 2 replicas could avoid single point failure, only for DataRegion, writings can be applied on each replica and replicated asynchronously to other replicas.</li><li>RatisConsensus：Provide Strong consistency, using raft consensus protocol, Could be used in any number of replicas, and could be used for any region groups.<br> Currently, DataRegion uses RatisConsensus does not support multiple data directories. This feature is planned to be supported in future releases.</li></ul></li></ul>',30);function s(r,c){return t(),i("div",null,[a(`
