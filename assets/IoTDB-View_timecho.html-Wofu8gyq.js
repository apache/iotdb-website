Therefore, the concept of sequence views in IoTDB is also built on sequences.</p><p>A sequence view is a virtual time series, and each virtual time series is like a soft link or shortcut that maps to a sequence or some kind of computational logic external to a certain view. In other words, a virtual sequence either maps to some defined external sequence or is computed from multiple external sequences.</p><p>Users can create views using complex SQL queries, where the sequence view acts as a stored query statement, and when data is read from the view, the stored query statement is used as the source of the data in the FROM clause.</p><h3 id="_2-3-alias-sequences" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-alias-sequences" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.3 Alias Sequences</h3><p>There is a special class of beings in a sequence view that satisfy all of the following conditions:</p><ol><li>the data source is a single time series</li><li>there is no computational logic</li><li>no filtering conditions (e.g., no WHERE clause restrictions).</li></ol><p>Such a sequence view is called an <strong>alias sequence</strong>, or alias sequence view.

I now want all the data queried through the view to be automatically converted to int64 type.</p><blockquote><p>Ans: This is not the function of the sequence view.

Select a number of time series and create a view; but I don&#39;t specify the name of each series, it is named automatically by the database?</p><blockquote><p>Ans: Not supported.
