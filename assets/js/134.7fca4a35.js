(12 million points per second may have reached the limit of gigabit network card)\nIn raw data query, as the query scope increases, the advantages of IoTDB begin to manifest. Because the granularity of data blocks is larger and the advantages of columnar storage are used, column-based compression and columnar iterators will both accelerate the query.\nIn aggregation query, we use the statistics of the file layer and cache the statistics. Therefore, multiple queries only need to perform memory calculations (do not need to traverse the original data points, and do not need to access the disk), so the aggregation performance advantage is obvious.\nDownsampling query scenarios is more interesting, as the time partition becomes larger and larger, the query performance of IoTDB increases gradually. Probably it has risen twice, which corresponds to the pre-calculated information of 2 granularities(3 hours and 4.5 days).
